# Wikipedia-Game
The Wikipedia game is a game where you have to start on one topic and end on another by clicking links within articles

This code is a generator for a topic to start on and one to end on, all it does is goes to the topics.txt file and randomly picks one, im adding a ton all the time


# Future Plans
Eventually I wanna make it so you can keep scores in the code if your playing with multiple people

Id also like to make a lot more topics
